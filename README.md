# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: Uaing import math function,do the calculations
### Step 2: Take the two coordinates as l1,l2.
### Step 3: 
<<<<<<< HEAD
Substitute the values in the distance formula  formula.JPG

```
p1=[4,2]
p2=[10,6]
x_diff=p2[0] - p1[0]
y_diff=p2[1] - p1[1]
dist = round((((x_diff)**2)+((y_diff)**2))**0.5,2)
print(dist)
```
### OUTPUT:
![output](image.png)
### RESULT:
Thus the program is executed and the output is achieved.
=======
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: Using the print function,display the distance between two points
### Step 5: End the program
### PROGRAM:

  


### OUTPUT:



### RESULT:
Thus the program has been executed successfully.
